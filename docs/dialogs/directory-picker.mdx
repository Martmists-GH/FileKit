## Quick start

Easily open a folder picker dialog to let users select a directory.

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin filekit-dialogs
val directory = FileKit.openDirectoryPicker()
```

```kotlin filekit-dialogs-compose
val launcher = rememberDirectoryPickerLauncher { directory ->
    // Handle the directory
}

Button(onClick = { launcher.launch() }) {
    Text("Pick a directory")
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Customizing the dialog

You can customize the dialog by setting the title and the initial directory.

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin filekit-dialogs
val directory = FileKit.openDirectoryPicker(
    title = "Directory picker",
    initialDirectory = "/custom/initial/path",
    platformSettings = platformSettings,
)
```
```kotlin filekit-dialogs-compose
val launcher = rememberDirectoryPickerLauncher(
    title = "Directory picker",
    initialDirectory = "/custom/initial/path",
    platformSettings = platformSettings,
) { directory ->
    // Handle the directory
}
```
