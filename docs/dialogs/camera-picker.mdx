<Check>Supported on Android and iOS targets</Check>

## Quick start

The camera picker component provides a native interface for users to capture photos using their device's camera.

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin filekit-dialogs
val file = FileKit.openCameraPicker()
```

```kotlin filekit-dialogs-compose
val launcher = rememberCameraPickerLauncher { file ->
    // Handle the captured photo
}

Button(onClick = { launcher.launch() }) {
    Text("Take a photo")
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Camera type

You can specify the type of media to capture using the `type` parameter:
- `Photo` - Capture a photo (default)
- `Video` - Capture a video (coming soon)

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin filekit-dialogs
val file = FileKit.openCameraPicker(type = FileKitCameraType.Photo)
```

```kotlin filekit-dialogs-compose
val launcher = rememberCameraPickerLauncher(
    type = FileKitCameraType.Photo
) { file ->
    // Handle the captured photo
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Video capture support is planned for a future release.
</Warning>

<Info>
The captured media file is automatically saved to a temporary location. If you need to keep the file permanently, make sure to copy it to a permanent storage location.
