## Quick start

The file saver component provides a native interface for users to choose where to save a file on their device.

The file saver dialog returns a `PlatformFile` object representing where the user wants to save the file. Note that the file is not created automatically - it's the developer's responsibility to write the actual data to the file location using methods like `write()`.

Here's a basic example:

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin filekit-dialogs
// Open file saver dialog
val file = FileKit.openFileSaver(
    baseName = "document",
    extension = "pdf"
)

// Write your data to the file
if (file != null) {
    file.write(bytes)
}
```

```kotlin filekit-dialogs-compose
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
val launcher = rememberFileSaverLauncher { file ->
    // Write your data to the file
    if (file != null) {
        scope.launch {
            file.write(bytes)
        }
    }
}

Button(onClick = { launcher.launch("document", "pdf") }) {
    Text("Save file")
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

The file saver can be customized with several parameters:

- `baseName` (default: "file"): The default name for the file without extension
- `extension`: The file extension without the dot (e.g., "pdf", "txt")
- `initialDirectory`: The starting directory for the save dialog
- `dialogSettings`: Platform-specific settings for customizing the dialog behavior

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin filekit-dialogs
val file = FileKit.openFileSaver(
    baseName = "my-document",
    extension = "pdf",
    initialDirectory = "/custom/initial/path",
    dialogSettings = FileKitDialogSettings.createDefault()
)
```

```kotlin filekit-dialogs-compose
val launcher = rememberFileSaverLauncher(
    initialDirectory = "/custom/initial/path",
    dialogSettings = FileKitDialogSettings.createDefault()
) { file ->
    // Handle the selected save location
}

launcher.launch("my-document", "pdf")
```
</CodeGroup>

Read more about [dialog settings](/dialogs/dialog-settings) to customize the dialog for each platform.

## Writing data

The file saver returns a `PlatformFile` object representing the selected save location. You can write data to this file using the `write()` extension function:

```kotlin
val file = FileKit.openFileSaver(baseName = "document", extension = "pdf")

if (file != null) {
    // Write bytes to the file
    file.write(bytes)
}
```

For more information about writing files, see the [write file guide](/core/write-file).

## Download file on the web

On web targets (JS and WASM), instead of using a file saver dialog, you can directly download a file using `FileKit.download()`:

```kotlin
// Download bytes
FileKit.download(
    bytes = "Hello, World!".encodeToByteArray(),
    fileName = "hello.txt"
)

// Download from a PlatformFile
val file: PlatformFile = ...
FileKit.download(file, fileName = "document.pdf")
```

This will trigger the browser's native download behavior, saving the file to the user's default downloads directory.

<Info>
On web targets, the file saver dialog is not supported due to browser security restrictions. Instead, use `FileKit.download()` to download files directly.
