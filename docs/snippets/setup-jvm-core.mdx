FileKit needs to have your application id to handle the app directory. Your application id is generally the package name or the name of your application. FileKit will use this `appId` as app directory.

We recommend you to initialize FileKit in your `main.kt` file:

```kotlin main.kt
fun main() = application {
  // Initialize FileKit
  FileKit.init(appId = "MyApplication")

  // Start your application
  Window(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
