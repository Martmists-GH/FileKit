## Installation

<VersionCore/>

FileKit Core provides the fundamental file operations for your Kotlin Multiplatform project. It's designed to work across all supported platforms with a unified API.

## Platform-specific setup

FileKit Core is designed to work out of the box for most platforms, but some targets require additional setup.

### Android setup

When using FileKit Core on Android, you need to initialize it in your application class or main activity:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        
        // Initialize FileKit with application context
        FileKit.init(applicationContext)
    }
}
```

### JVM setup

<SetupJVMCore/>

The application ID is used to create user-specific directories on different operating systems:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\your.application.id\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/your.application.id/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/your.application.id/`

### iOS, macOS, JS, WASM setup

No additional setup is needed for iOS, macOS, JS, and WASM targets. FileKit Core works out of the box on these platforms.
