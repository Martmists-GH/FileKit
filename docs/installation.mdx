import FilekitVersion from '/snippets/filekit-version.mdx'

To use FileKit in your Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform project, you need to add the dependency to your `build.gradle.kts` file.

FileKit supports those targets:
- Android
- iOS, macOS
- JVM (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- JS, WASM

## Dialogs

FileKit can helps you to display dialogs to the user like file, directory and photo pickers, save dialogs, camera and more. FileKit dialogs are available in two flavors:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
// Enables FileKit dialogs without Compose dependencies
implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-dialogs:0.10.0")

// Enables FileKit dialogs with Composable utilities
implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-dialogs-compose:0.10.0")
```

## PlatformFile

FileKit provides a platform-agnostic file abstraction called `PlatformFile`. It allows you to work with files in a platform-agnostic way. You can create, read, write, and delete files using the `PlatformFile` API.

You can use `PlatformFile` in your project by adding the following dependency:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-core:0.10.0")
```

## Coil

FileKit provides a Coil extension to load images from a `PlatformFile` object. You can use the `PlatformFile` object to load images from a file.

You can use the Coil extension in your project by adding the following dependency:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-coil:0.10.0")
```

## Linux setup

If using JVM target and Linux distribution, you need to add the following module:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
compose.desktop {
    application {
        nativeDistributions {
            linux {
                modules("jdk.security.auth")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

It prevents having a `NoClassDefFoundError` on some cases. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/vinceglb/FileKit/issues/107).
