To use FileKit in your Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform project, you need to add the dependency to your `build.gradle.kts` file.

FileKit supports those targets:
- Android
- iOS, macOS
- JVM (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- JS, WASM

## Dialogs

<VersionDialogs/>

## PlatformFile

<VersionCore/>

## Coil

FileKit provides a Coil extension to load images from a `PlatformFile` object. You can use the `PlatformFile` object to load images from a file.

You can use the Coil extension in your project by adding the following dependency:

<CodeGroup>

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-coil:0.10.0")
```

```toml libs.versions.toml
[versions]
filekit = "0.10.0"

[libraries]
filekit-coil = { module = "io.github.vinceglb:filekit-coil", version.ref = "filekit" }
```

</CodeGroup>

## Linux setup

If using JVM target and Linux distribution, you need to add the following module:

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
compose.desktop {
    application {
        nativeDistributions {
            linux {
                modules("jdk.security.auth")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

It prevents having a `NoClassDefFoundError` on some cases. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/vinceglb/FileKit/issues/107).
