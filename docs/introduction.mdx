FileKit is a lightweight yet powerful library that simplifies file operations across multiple platforms using Kotlin Multiplatform. 

Whether you need to pick files, save documents, access photos, or manage directories, FileKit provides a consistent API that works seamlessly on Android, iOS, macOS, JVM (Windows, macOS, Linux), JS, and WASM.

```kotlin
// Pick an image file
val imageFile = FileKit.openFilePicker(type = FileKitType.Image)

// Pick multiple files
val files = FileKit.openFilePicker(mode = FileKitMode.Multiple())

// Pick a directory
val directory = FileKit.openDirectoryPicker()

// Save a file
PlatformFile(directory, "image.png").write(imageFile)
```

## Modular Structure

FileKit is designed to be modular, allowing you to include only what you need:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[FileKit Core] --> B[FileKit Dialogs]
    B --> C[FileKit Dialogs Compose]
    A --> E[FileKit Coil]
```

- **FileKit Core**: Basic file operations and the `PlatformFile` abstraction
- **FileKit Dialogs**: File pickers and save dialogs without UI dependencies
- **FileKit Dialogs Compose**: Compose Multiplatform integration for file operations
- **FileKit Coil**: Integration with Coil for image loading
