## PlatformFile

The `PlatformFile` class represents a file in a platform-specific way. Each target provides its own implementation of this class to interact with the file system.

### Properties

#### `name: String?`

The name of the file, including its extension, if available. Returns `null` if the name cannot be determined or the file does not exist.

#### `size: Long?`

The size of the file in bytes. Returns `null` if the file does not exist or its size cannot be determined.

#### `path: Path?`

The platform-specific file path. Returns `null` if the path is not available or applicable (e.g., Uri-based files on Android).

#### `parent: PlatformFile?`

Returns the parent directory of this `PlatformFile`. Returns `null` if the parent directory is not available or applicable.

#### `isFile: Boolean`

Returns `true` if this `PlatformFile` represents a regular file. Returns `false` if it represents a directory or does not exist.

#### `isDirectory: Boolean`

Returns `true` if this `PlatformFile` represents a directory. Returns `false` if it represents a file or does not exist.

#### `exists: Boolean`

Returns `true` if this `PlatformFile` exists in the file system. Returns `false` if it does not exist.

### Functions

#### `suspend fun readBytes(): ByteArray?`

Reads the content of the file as a `ByteArray`. Returns the content of the file, or `null` if the file cannot be read or does not exist.

#### `fun source(): RawSource?`

Returns a `RawSource` for reading from this `PlatformFile`. Returns `null` if a source cannot be opened.

#### `fun sink(append: Boolean = false): RawSink?`

Returns a `RawSink` for writing to this `PlatformFile`. If `append` is set to `true`, the content will be appended; otherwise, it will overwrite the existing content. Returns `null` if a sink cannot be opened.

#### `suspend infix fun write(bytes: ByteArray): Boolean`

Writes the given `bytes` to this `PlatformFile`. Returns `true` if the write operation is successful, `false` otherwise.

#### `suspend infix fun write(platformFile: PlatformFile): Boolean`

Writes the content of another `PlatformFile` to this file. Returns `true` if the write operation is successful, `false` otherwise.

#### `suspend infix fun copyTo(destination: PlatformFile): Boolean`

Copies the content of this `PlatformFile` to the `destination` file. Returns `true` if the copy operation is successful, `false` otherwise.

#### `suspend fun delete(mustExist: Boolean = true): Boolean`

Deletes this `PlatformFile` from the file system. If `mustExist` is set to `true`, throws an error if the file does not exist. Returns `true` if the file is successfully deleted, `false` otherwise.

#### `operator fun div(child: String): PlatformFile`

Creates a `PlatformFile` by appending a `child` path to the `base` file's path. Returns a new `PlatformFile` representing the combined path, or `null` if the base path is invalid.

### Example Usage

```kotlin
// Create a PlatformFile from a Path
val file = PlatformFile(path)

// Read bytes from the file
val bytes = file.readBytes()

// Write bytes to the file
file.write("Hello, World!".encodeToByteArray())

// Copy the file to another location
file.copyTo(destinationFile)

// Delete the file
file.delete()
